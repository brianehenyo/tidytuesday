# #TidyTuesday 17

For this #TidyTuesday, we focused on the MyAnimeList dataset. I tried to visualize the scores in relationship with the ratings, types and number of fans that favorited them. I saw the early submission of @commitedtotape and decided to recreate his style. Through this, I got to try the `paletteer` package.
